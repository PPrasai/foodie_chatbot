Problem Statement
An Indian startup named 'Foodie' wants to build a conversational bot (chatbot) which can help users discover restaurants across several Indian cities. 

The main purpose of the bot is to help users discover restaurants quickly and efficiently and to provide a good restaurant discovery experience. It is assumed that the startup only serves information about the Tier 1 cities of india and available cuisines are only North Indian, South Indian, Mexican, Italian, Chinese and American.

The bot should be able to dispatch the search results to the consumer's email address (if s/he opts to).
